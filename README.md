# HTTP-to-HTTPS-Proxy
The goal of this project is to develop a proxy HTTP server that can accept HTTP requests from clients and convert them to HTTPS requests to the web server. In addition, the HTTP request can be filtered based on an access control list. The requests can be generated by any Web client, such as the curl command or a web browser.
